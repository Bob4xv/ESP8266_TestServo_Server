# ESP8266_TestServo_Server
Using WeeMos device to create a web server on your network to test operation of multiple servo motors.

This project is to be used to evalue the performance of servo motors to control varable capacitors and rotary switches to be used in an antenna matching unit for various HF frequencies.

The WeeMos controller connects to a local wifi network and presents its self as a web page.  The web page has slider controls to position the servo motors for the caps and another to control a rotary 6 position switch.

Libraries required:  ESP8266WiFi and Servo.

This project is still under development.
